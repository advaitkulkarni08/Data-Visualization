# Data-Visualization Project
For this project, I have used Human Freedom Index dataset from Kaggle.
Created an Interactive report of Human Freedom Index using R Programming. 
Through this visualization, I have attempted to show different trends of Personal and Economic Freedom factors of all countries in the world.
In addition, I have shown the freedom level in terms of Law, Money, Military, Same Sex Marriage, Women Inheritence 
of all countries in the world from 2008 to 2016.
With the help of Sliders and Drop-Downs, the user can manipulate the visualization and witness the degree of freedom.
